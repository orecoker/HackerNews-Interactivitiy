# HackerNews Interactivitiy
### March 2023

## As a developer, I individually explored a data set of posts made on a webpage to create insights. 
## Using a dataset of posts from HackerNews as my source, I looked through the data and specifically looked at posts beginning with Ask HN or Show HN to compare the types of posts and see what gains the most interaction.

## Initially cleaning the dataset and making it fit for analysis, I removed empty records, or records without comments to focus on posts that have garnered interaction. 

## I took a random sample of 10% of the records for easier analysis and transformed the dataframe into a list of records so I could look through each record and analyze its title, number of comments, and points.

## Comparing the total and average number of comments and points for each post allowed me to discover the following:
### While ask posts recieved more comments on average, show posts recieved approx 15 more points on average. This makes sense as posts asking questions are expected to have a good amount of comment responses answering the posted question. When people make a post showing their work, others will upvote/rate it points so others may see the work.
